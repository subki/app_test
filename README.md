Node JS Backend Test

- Import the database into mysql
- Change the port in ./config.js if nodejs are conflict
- API CRUD for Brand, Outlet, Product tables
  All table have the image, picture, logo or banner. I create an additional table for storing the image path.
  You can get these images call the API /images with filter field by ref_id and table_id
